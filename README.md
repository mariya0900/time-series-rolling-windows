 "# Daily Min Temperature Forecasting using Rolling Windows and RNN"
 "I will be using the [Daily Minimum Temperatures in Melbourne](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/blob/master/daily-min-temperatures.csv) dataset which contains data of the daily minimum temperatures recorded in Melbourne from 1981 to 1990. In addition to be using Tensorflow's layers for processing sequence data such as Recurrent layers or LSTMs I will also use Convolutional layers to improve the model's performance."
This is original data with indices instead of time stamps (for an easier split)
